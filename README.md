Running
=======

The game requires GTK 3.0 with python introspection installed.
Your safest bet would be to run gnome shell, or being able to
run gnome shell.

Call ./apx.py to run the game


Game description and goal
==========================

APX is a [QIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix) clone with minor differences in gameplay from the original.

Use arrow keys to move around the perimeter of square, hold down Space or Shift  
to cut into the area. Connect back to perimeter to claim the area.

Your objective is to claim 75% or more to proceed to the next level

Claiming with Shift key will be slower but give you double the points.

For every claimed full percent over 75% you get extra 1000 points.


Implementation
==============

The game was implemented using 
[hamster graphics](https://github.com/projecthamster/experiments)
and somewhat serves also as a tech demo. Check out the tutorial!
